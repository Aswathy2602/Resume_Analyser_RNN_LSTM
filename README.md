Matching a resume to a job description is crucial but often time-consuming. The goal is to simplify this process by analyzing resumes to see how well they align with job descriptions and offering recommendations to improve them. Utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), ensures accurate analysis and feedback. Built with Python and Streamlit, the system provides suggestions for enhancing resume content, making it more appealing to employers. This approach enables job seekers to optimize their resumes effectively, improving their chances of securing interviews.
This project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud (https://streamlit.io/cloud).
